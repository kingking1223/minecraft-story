<h4>Chapter 1: Seems fine Part 1: The beginning of everything</h4>
<p>It is a nice and sunny day. Tom just bought a game named Minecraft. So, he opened the game and try playing. He created a new world. "Em... multiplayer...? Let us 
disable it." Said Tom. Then, he started chopping down some woods. He thought that just by multi clicking it will make it work and be able to chop down the tree. But, 
actually, you have to keep pressing the left key. Although he has many problem on the way, he is now going into the way that he cannot escape.</p>
<br></br>
<p>His friend, Carman knew that he has bought the game, and she also plays it, so she asked for his IGN. "I for India, C for Charlie, E for Echo. S for Sierra, 
U for Uniform, C for Charlie, K for Kilo, S for Sierra. Got it?" He is telling her his IGN. Carman knew that he has just played the game for a short time, so she 
reminds him to open multiplayer. At this moment, Carman's mom, Alice saw her playing Minecraft, so she asked who she is playing with and what is the game. After 
hearing her answers, she thought it may be a good game for her friend, Emma's daughter, so she tells Emma about this game and Emma told her that her daughter 
already has this game. Now they three are all playing together. But little did they know, disaster is coming. Carman's little sister, Mary saw her playing.</p>
